# STARBUCKS CAPSTONE PROJECT
In this project I would be exploring the starbuck and created a machine learning model that predict the offer a person recieves from starbucks and if the individual complete their orders. There are 3 dataset to be explored in this project. The data in this project was downloaded here. The result of this project would give insight on how offers leads to sales comversion

## ACKNOWLEDGE
I want to acknowledge with profound gratitude all the writers cited in this work and Udacity for this opportunity to learn

## DATA CREDIT
UDACITY

STARBUCKs

##  PROJECT MOTIVATION
This project is meant to answer some questions that stakeholders would have about the different promo offers that starbuck offers, giving clearity to the conversion rate of the promo

## DATA UNDERSTANDING
The data is contained in three files:

portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json - demographic data for each customer
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:

portfolio.json

id (string) - offer id
offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational
difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer
reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer
duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days
channels (list of strings)
profile.json

age (int) - age of the customer
became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account
gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)
id (str) - customer id
income (float) - customer's income
transcript.json

event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)
person (str) - customer id
time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0
value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record

### DATA PREPARATION
Dealing with incorrect data type: The became_member_on column in the profile.json file is strings.

Missing Values: The missing values in the gender column of the profile.json file was replaced by the male gender. Also the income column in the same dataset has missing variable which was replaced with the mean income

### LIBRARIES USED
The following libraries were used to excute this project

Numpy
Pandas
Matplot
Seaborn
Scikit Learn
stat.model
Installations:
This libraries work in latest python and they can be installed by running this code

pip install -r requirement.txt

### SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS
I built two models using 4 different classifiers on two different scenarios one including the offer type as aprt of the independent variable and the other excluding it. 

The acccuracy for the first model are as follows:

Model	Accuracy Score
0 KNN	0.735714
1	RANDOM FOREST	0.643182
2	ADA BOOST	0.725649
3	Naive Bayes	0.447499

The second model includes the offer type(bogo, discount and information) as part of the independent variable

The acccuracy for the second  model are as follows:

Model Accuracy Score

0 KNN	0.735714
1	RANDOM FOREST	0.643182
2	ADA BOOST	0.725649
3	Naive Bayes	0.447499
